(7x)
Make your move... Across the line
Make your move... Come on, dare me!
I've got a chip on my shoulder
With your name on it
So don't just stand there foolin'
If you don't want it
I say you're either a lover
Or you are a liar
So don't you push too hard
You're playin' with fire
(2x)
Baby make your move, step across the line
Touch me one more time, come on, dare me!
Wanna take you on, I know I can't lose
I'll be loving you if you just dare me
Looks like you're lookin' for trouble
And I'd say you found it
You'll have to come right through me
There's no way around it
I hope that lean hungry look
Means what it's saying
'Cause I'm just sittin' on ready
Ready and waiting
(2x)
Baby make your move, step across the line
Touch me one more time, come on, dare me!
Wanna take you on, I know I can't lose
I'll be loving you if you just dare me
