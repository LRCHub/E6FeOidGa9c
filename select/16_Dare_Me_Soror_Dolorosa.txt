Dear soul
Dare me to introduce myself
In those pages I'd like to see you fill
At the same that you emptied my life
And my soul. Fill all my spirit
I do not want to be prolix and I fear
With no doubt, and dirtying
Your future feelings
I do not want to be sure of me
With no hours
Enclosing to your future feelings
Nevertheless, take this skin
As a mark, a gage of;
As a mark of you in me
This mark of you in me
As the witness crys this feeling's reading inside of
Of me
The cadaver can be exquisite
- Agathe

It stands still on the hours and decades
A gate

The pure aspect of your intimate, tonight
So dare me, to introduce myself
Without any word and anything
Within anything that can kiss my lips
Crushes on your skin forever
Crushes on my skin, forever

With nothing left but a lace
With nothing left but the trace
With nothing left on my skin and disgrace!
My skin and disgrace
All lovers
You and I
